Each ordering of cats is considered a different post-card. Each post-card as the same number of cats in it. What's the smallest number of cats that should be in each post-card to achieve at least one million unique post-cards? Use a `while` loop, a break statement, and your function from the previous question. You must use python tutor on this problem to receive full credit"

Complete the following tasks:\n",

    "1. Write a function which takes in a principal, $P$, maturation rate of $r$, and withdrawl amount of $W$. It returns the amount of money remaining. Withdrawl occurs before maturation. Using your function, with a principal of \\$250,000 and the numbers given above, how much money remains after 1 year? Call this function annual.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a new function called terminator which takes in $P$, $r$ and $W$. It should use your annual function and a for loop. It returns the number of years before your principal is gone and you have no more retirement money. Since you're using a for loop, you should have some upper bound. Let's use 50 for that upper bound. To test your method, you should get 11 years using the numbers from part 1.\n",

    "4. Make your terminator (for this part only) have an upper bonud for 1000 years. You are a vampire. Make a plot from \\$100,000 to \\$750,000. How much money do you need in retirement as a vampire?"
