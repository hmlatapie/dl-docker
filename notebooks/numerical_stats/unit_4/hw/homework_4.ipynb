    "Mammograms are a testing procedure for breast cancer. The diagnosis procedure after a mammogram is positive is incredibly complex. We'll simplify a little bit here. If a mammogram test is positive, a woman will always return for a biopsy. A biopsy is the removal and analysis of a small amount of breast tissue. If a biopsy is positive we will assume it leads to a mastectomy. The statistics from here on out are mostly correct, but biopsy does not always follow a mammogram in real life. From ages 40 to 50, 45% of women who receive annual mammograms will have a false positive and 25% have a false negative. A false negative means that a woman had invasive breast cancer but the test did not show it. A false positive means a woman had no or benign cancer. A large study of biopsies shows that biopsies are correctly diagnosed 75% of the time (the state of cancer matches the state of the biopsy), with false positives being twice as likely as false negatives. You may assume that biopsies and mammograms are conditionally independent on the presence or absence of cancer. After positive finding from a mammogram and biopsy, a mastectomy is performed which has a 0.24% probability of mortality. That mortality probability is independent of all factors. The overall probability of having invasive breast cancer is 1.5% between the ages of 40 to 50. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the probability of a positive mammogram result?\n",
    "2. Given a mammogram is positive, what's the probability a woman has invasive cancer?\n",
    "3. What's the probability of dying from a mastectomy?\n",
    "4. The mastectomy and treatment has a 97% survival rate. That number is for women with invasive breast cancer. We can assume a near 100% survivale rate for those that did not have invasive cancer but underwent treatment. If a woman with cancer is not diagnosed from a mammogram or biopsy, she will be diagnosed later due to symptoms with an overall survivale rate of 93%. What's the probability of dying from cancer?\n",
    "5. Given that there are 20 million women aged 40 to 50, what's the expected number of deaths from cancer and mastectomy? I would like to emphasize that there are many more dangers from cancer treatment than mastectomy and that even though it appears cancer is a larger problem, there are other mortality risks and quality of life changes from unnecessary cancer treatment. \n",

    "*Answer each question first with equations and markdown (symbolically) as far as possible. You can use previous answers here or given parameters, but do not compute arithmetic until the end. Final answer may be given in Python or markdown.*"
