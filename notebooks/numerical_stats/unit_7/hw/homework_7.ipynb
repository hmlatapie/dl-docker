Your slider should go from 0 to 2 and each value should result in a latex display showing the eigenvalue and eigenvector. Note that Python eats `{}` in strings, so you'll have to use `{{}}`. This is called escaping. Python also eats many things that have a backslash. For example, `\\b` means backspace to python. And `\\\\` means `\\` in python.  So you'll have to write  `\\\\` when you want LaTeX to see `\\` and in general use some trial in error about backslashes. You can never have too many though! For example, write `\\\\begin{{array}}` to start your matrix. Use three `''' for example'''` to have a string that spans multiple lines. [Summary comic](http://xkcd.com/1638/). Practice getting the LaTeX correct before putting it all together."
